When Chase felt he was about to go completely insane, Cannibal's ego that was sleeping inside Monolith spoke to Chase.\nIt told Chase to succumb to its flame. Once he gives in, the voices will disappear.\nTrue to Cannibal's words, Chase could avoid hearing the voices while using Monolith, but he started relying on it more and more.\n\nUpon seeing Chase harnessing the flame that also damages its wielder, Scarlet scolded him heavily, but whenever the battle would take place, Chase, even after saying that he will try not to use Monolith, would mindlessly swing the Flame of Monolith.\nWorried that Chase may one day go berserk again, Scarlet requested Annette, the kingdom's revered technomagi, to investigate Chase and Monolith. Upon investigating, Annette found out that Monolith has become a vessel for the Soul of Cannibal, the Beast of Arrogance, and that Cannibal's Mana was affecting Chase's. Annette also told Scarlet that Cannibal has been feeding upon Chase's hidden anxiety and his longing for the ones he had forgotten, and that if Chase doesn't do something, Cannibal will one day consume Chase who left a scar on it. Nonetheless, Chase marches on with faith that he will not succumb to the flaming beast, with his comrades from the castle who provide endless support and encouragement."
