One day, Ricardo came to visit Cecilia in the Empire, and Cecilia told him that she would join the Resistance. He saw from her eyes that her mind was set. He then gave her the Magic Stone of Tempest, saying, 'Show the world what you believe in.' Later, Landet, the geek engineer of the Resistance recognized the value of the Magic Stone and created these powerful boots."
