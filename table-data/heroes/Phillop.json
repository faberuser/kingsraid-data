After some thought, Phillop ground the Horn of the First Dwarven King and applied it to Atein.\n\nThe result was nothing short of a great success. The evil residues etched in the remains could not help but succumb to the energy of the mighty Dwarven king, and they no longer resisted its master.\nWith the strongest Dwarf by his side, Phillop had nothing to fear.\nWhenever Phillop swung Atein, he could feel the First Dwarven King's hearty laughter and his mighty presence."
