However, he takes pride in his power and does not try to hide it. Since he is only partly Demon, only a single arm undergoes the transformation. However, even just this single arm contains immense power, and it's certainly not easy for him to fully control it yet. elif he loses the control of the arm, the only wise decision is to immediately get as far away from him as possible.",

To become stronger than what he was, Ezekiel had to find his own way of using power. Since he was not a pure human, its ways had limits.\nHowever, since Ezekiel was also not a pure Demon, its way was not an option to him either. Ezekiels, wrought in agony over their power, had a discussion on one possible option: Fully unleashing the power acquired from father. No power can be properly wielded without understanding it, It was the one thing Ezekiels heard from a credible person. To Ezekie\u013e's surprise, the power of Demon, unleashed with a strong intent, was devastating. His claws left a long cut on a dimension. Ezekiel had witnessed such, and when he approached the dimension's scar with a surprised look, a dense demonic energy leaked out from the scar, Although he had never come into contact with one, the energy felt familiar to him.\nThat moment, Ezekiel realized what he had done. He understood the nature of the demonic energy. From then and onwards, Ezekiel could see the power of Barbatos directly."
