He was a renowned mage and artist in ancient times who traveled all across the continent to give joy to people and help them forget their troubles. His performance was a solace and hope to people living in confusing times, and they loved him to the extent that they made the Moon of Hexipolia after he passed away in honor of his noble spirit. However, the mentally demanding nature of Hexipolia's craft slowly gnawed into his soul, making him suffer from loneliness and depression. He wanted to give up on his natural gift, but the shadow cast upon people was just too deep; he knew too well what his performances meant to his audience. It was his destiny to amuse people. Lu Etrona Dice is what he made to amuse himself during his painful journey of entertainment. He condensed his Mana into the dice and gave it the power to form a dimensional illusion. When rolled, the dice opened up an imaginary world where Hexipolia could find some peace. The dice was passed down to the descendants of his life-long pursuit for clowning, but it disappeared when the ancient civilization collapsed. And now, the dice is in the hands of a man called the Illusion Gambler. Being used in a completely different way, against its maker's intentions... It is said that the dice appeared in Esker's hands with blinding lights when he desperately wanted to escape this world."
