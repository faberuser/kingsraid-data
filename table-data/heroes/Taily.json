The contenders would charge their energy and engrave a footprint-shaped seal onto the hammer, and the one with the strongest seal would be the owner of the hammer.\nIt was deemed fair and just since once the engraved seal disappeared, the owner would then retire, and the Shuti tribe members would gather again to hold a new contest.\nYoung Taily won the latest contest by engraving the strongest footprint seal in history, and became the rightful owner of Prochika.\n\nAs a side note, there are many on-going discussions about the etymology of the name 'Prochika,' but it is widely accepted that it was the word which the Shuti ancestors used to describe their moments of enlightenment."
