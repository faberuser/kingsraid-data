The young dragon's imagination flowed like a stream of water from a lake, and reached the conclusion nobody thought of: it awakened the water elemental residing in Cielamaha, an entity that accompanied the First Blue Dragon in the ancient times.\nThe awakened water elemental had a doubt on young Lilia's potential, and on whether she was worthy of wielding Cielamaha. Trials were given to her, yet she overcame them through the flexible use of water.\n\nIt then accepted Lilia, and now Lilia can harness a water tempest stronger than that of other Blue Dragons with the aid of the water elemental."
