Her change was manifested via Del Terravion.\nWhen Isolet joined Pandora, an organization that opposes the Empire, she wa able to add an extra power output device on Del Terravion using Pandora's technomagic technology. She swore that she will never be powerless nor have anything taken away from her. To do so, she needed power more than ever, even it it meant that she will have to walk the path painted in blood and covered in curses and resentment. The forced technomagic output device engulfed Del Terravion's heart with sunlight, removing any trace of the azure color that once existed. Each time the staff was processed, Isolet could hear Del Terravion's scream - the scream of Del Terravion struggling in pain and sorrow. Only Isolet who could hear these painful screams, and she thought that they sounded exactly like her. To her, sounded exactly like her cries form her nightmare, from when she had to watch her friend die every night. Thus, Isolet guarded Pandora#s workshop every time Del Terravion was processed. It was Isolet's way of executing herself. Because she was pure, she ended up experiencign loss.\nOnce Del Terravion, the relic of the witches, was combined with the power of the technomagic taht mocks magic, it exuded overwhelming power like nothing before. The dragon within the staff with wings that once embraced the sky, is now boudn to a desolate apparatus. It is now but an empty shell of a guardian that is stripped of its glory. Isolet named this shell Gigantes."
