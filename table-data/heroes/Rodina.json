However, even Rodina misses her shots sometimes.\nThat is because to successfully hit the target, one does not only need a good sniper and a good weapon, but also other aspects such as good environmental condition, and good calculation.\nOne can expect success only when 'the best condition' has been set through the combination of various factors. Also even then, there is also many uncontrollable odds involved, such as luck.\nRodina did not deny such, and she did not give up. Rodina decided to focus on factors she could control, and improve her skills to the max. Thus, she went to a snow mountain to improve her concentration. A snow mountain was considered the best place to hone concentration, as it requires extreme concentration to hit a moving target through falling snow, and sight-impairing mist of the snow mountain. Rodina continued honing her skills to meet the goal of her training.\nThen one day, Rodina found herself being wrapped by a strange sensation. Even though her sight was impaired due to fatigue, she could somehow see the target clearly.\nShe pulled the trigger instinctively, and that's when Rodina detected a crosshair that had appeared in front of the rifle. It was the rifle's gift to its master who had completed her herculean training."
