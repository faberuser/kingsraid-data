I believe this is the reason you were friends with Crow all this time.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, perhaps.\u201d\nValance, known to have no friends or lover, is not a social nor affable person at all. Valance is a straight-talker, and Crow is a man of few words, who usually speaks through his eyes than his mouth. There\u2019s quite an age difference between these two, however, they were able to get close to each other as they shared similar personalities. They both have mentioned they wouldn\u2019t date or marry anyone at all, but things turned out unexpectedly. Who would have thought Valance\u2019s best friend would become the wife of that foolish man?",

        "story_": "Magos Le'Flamme is the Vespian Empire's largest weapons development organization and the best Technomagic research institution. Its chief director is Valance de Charlie, the greatest mind of Technomagic. Like anyone with natural talents in a certain field, ever since her teenage years, Valance displayed great skills in handling Technomagic and crafting. Valance was recognized for her talent and joined the academy at a young age after skipping grades. Of course, not everything was flowers and roses for her as there were those who were jealous of her brilliance as as others who wished to take hold of her researches. Yet Valance ignored them all, focusing only on her research and study. Right after graduating from the academy. she officially became a researcher in Magos Le'Flamme, the Technomagic research institution where the Empire's most talented Technomagic experts gather.\nBeing rather unfriendly and having scathing remarks, she was not known to have many friends. Still, there were few precious individuals that could be considered as her friend: Crow who graduated from the same school (he failed to advance to the next grade several times), and Rose who was her classmate. Rose loved Crow unconditionally, wishing for his happiness, and was the only one who understood Valance. Crow silently accompanied Rose who showed him such love. Valance deeply cherished both her friends. But Rose, the one whom Valance could fall back to and trusted, was killed tragically along with her daughter after being caught in a huge conspiracy that was starting to take root in the Empire and drawing attention from a group called Pandora. And so Rose became Valance's only regret and sadness. Remembering her, she joined forces with Crow and swore vengeance on those who orchestrated Rose's demise.\nHer silent and lofty exterior belie her assertive and straightforward demeanor. She will not hesitate to blurt out and play rough, believing that one needs to be proactive to achieve success. Adventurous and progressive , Valance believes that the future is for those who grab it with their own hands, and such a mindset shows her enterprising tendency. On a side note, she has a strong desire to learn. Whenever she encounters a situation that she cannot understand - especially if it is related to Technomagic - she will become agitated while muttering 'This doesn't make sense.' It might be seen as an unexpected charming point for her who is being rational all the time.\nSometimes she crafts weapons for the Hound Unit for free, but she still accepts payments whenever she performs an enhancement or repair. Those in the unit seem to be unaware, but it is certain that someone's wallet got lighter."

Inside the temporary workshop that belonged to a nameless technomagi with unprecedented brilliance, she spent days and nights dedicated to her research. At last, she succeeded in interpreting the automatic maneuver process of the Technomagic Kingdom Guardians and inputting it into her weapon.\n- Oh,you made something impressive again! It can move on its own? This is amaz-argh!!\n- That's\u00a0why you shouldn't go around touching other people's\u00a0stuff.\n- Hahaha!! You have a hole in your clothes, mongrel!! \n...Valance sighed as she watched the Hound Unit that unexpectedly helped to test the weapon's effectiveness and wondered what it should be named. Behind the members stood Crow with his arms crossed\n- ...She would've liked it.\n- What?\n- Rose would've liked it. It's\u00a0her favorite color.\nLooking at Crow holding a lollipop in his mouth and putting a faint smile of reminiscing the past, Valance was suddenly struck with inspiration. Corbeau Rose.

But the feature was not used after the weapon was equipped with the automatic maneuver system, so she transformed the gadget into a simple input device. While it looks plain, its structure is surprisingly complicated: it operates by recognizing Valance's fingerprints and the password needs to be entered within a set period of time. Valance added multiple security measures just in case someone takes hold of the device and tries to hack into Magos Le'Flamme. There used to be one more person who could use the device. A brilliant mind who could understand and memorize the complicated code like Valance, the only figure that she willingly allowed to use Magos Le'Flamme's database: Rose Christina.

Naturally, she always carried a small number of tea leaves inside her pockets. But the cup posed a challenge. Valance could use Corbeau Rose to pour water at the right temperature, but a cup was difficult to carry around because it could be easily broken.\nIn the end, Valance came up with a solution, ordering a teacup holder that can be tied around her waist, one that is capable of storing a teacup and cup mat. It could also have a small teaspoon. Because it was made with leather, it was sturdy enough to contain a slightly heavy cup as well. One of the researchers joked if Valance, as a chief director, is okay with draping a leather belt instead of a Technomagic device, and to this Valance replied, 'As a Chief Director, I should not be picky with any technologies and materials.' Whether she was joking or was being serious remains a mystery in Magos Le'Flamme."

Only after the fourth Empress of the Empire Arentzevelia succeeded the throne was there progress; the Empress started allocating a large portion of the Empire's resources to train technomagis and develop the technology. Until then, the Empire's scientific technology merely mimicked that of the Republic of Grat. But with the Empress' support, the Empire developed military technology, unlike the Republic that mainly developed technology related to improving social infrastructure and utility. While the Empire is yet to catch up with the technologies of the Republic, it is innovating unique military aspects. It was during this period when Valance who was studying in the academy began researching Technomagic.\nBut being in a nation that did not have much history in technology, her progress was slow and was met with numerous impediments. After gathering books about Technomagic from all over the Empire and studying them, she invented a device that could generate Technomagic energy. But as if reminding that this was her first attempt, the device refused to even turn on.\n- Where did it go wrong? No matter what I try. I can't seem to figure out the problem. I think it would be best to start all over.\n- Hold on. Let's try one more time. Your research wasn't wrong. A little tweak would be all that is needed.\n- But this is the third time. Didn't you see it for yourself, Rose?\n- Then we do it the fourth time! It might work this time. Believe in yourself, Valance. You'll be able to make it this time.\nHearing Rose's encouraging words, Valance changed her mind and fixed a part of the device instead of completely disposing of it. Eventually, she succeeded in creating an energy source by operating the device. Her success encouraged the academy to give her full support and she soon became a researcher of Magos Le'Flamme. Even if you fail multiple times, it is important to try one more time. Remembering her dear friend's encouragement, Valance still keeps the switch that she used in her first experiment."

        "story": "Corbeau Rose made by Valance was an impressive weapon on its own, but it could not fully harbor every battle technology of Magos Le'Flamme. It was not that Valance was lacking in her skills or the weapon was faulty; it is because Corbeau Rose was made with heavy focus on portability. Valance, of course, knew the limits of her weapon well. But instead of improving its combat efficiency,\u00a0she sought to improve it in other fields.\n- That dummy, Mitra, Pansirone, and Kibera... they are all specialized in combat. So long as I have them to protect me, the current combat system is enough. Then... what I\u00a0need is this. A support feature to\u00a0utilize them appropriately. Increasing the scan range to figure out where the troublemakers are, adding search and analysis features to quickly identify unknown enemies, generating jamming signals to retreat or buy time to recuperate... Once she decided what to do,\u00a0it did not take long for her to establish the needed system. Having witnessed the highly advanced technology of Lucern, the origin of Technomagic, with her own eyes, obstacles hold her back.\nAfter finishing the final maintenance, she tested the weapon's call signal inside the storeroom of Magos Le'Flamme. She knew whom she could ask for the final test.\n- What do you think? Do you think it will be useful?\nHer taciturn friend replied by blasting the targets quicker and more precisely than any previous moments with help of the coordinates given by Corbeau Rose's enhanced system.\u00a0Once again\u00a0Valance would leave a mark in the history of the Empire's Technomagic technology."
