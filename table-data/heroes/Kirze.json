They were seeking out albino kids, ones who were born with unique and powerful magic. Malduk's subordinates captured these children, and injected them with crimson arcane crystals, a powerful energy source for Demons. The goal of this experiment was to transform them into crimson arcane crystal living mines - that would mass produce crimson arcane crystals until the moment they die. Pain from the inhumane experiment took its toll on the children and one by one, losing their lives. Children who weren't compatible with the crimson arcane crystal were petrified and crumbled into dust. The remaining children who witnessed this horror were shaking with fear, and hopelessly awaited their death. But the experiment finally came to a success. Crimson arcane crystals resonated with Kirze, and she absorbed all the crystals in the area. As a result, she gained vast amount of mana and gained ability to manipulate crimson arcane crystals at her will. With her new found power, Kirze defeated Malduk's subordinates and fled from the lab with the surviving children. In the hopes of preventing further casualties like herself, Kirze took off and began to hunt rouge demons that crossed her path..."
