        "story": "Kibera, true to his infamous title as the sword collector, owns countless demonic swords. Among those demonic swords, he has taken a special liking to 3 particular swords: Dark Shadow, Night Sky, and Veil, which he carries around all the time.\n\nThe demonic sword Dark Shadow is a demonic sword from the east that Kibera was carrying even before he came to the Empire. Dark Shadow carries the legend of a fiend that terrorized the Easter continent since ancient times, even before the Demon invasion. Long ago, eight humans and monster had united to defeat this fiend that was harming humans and eating other monsters. After a fierce battle that lasted for 3 days and nights, the fiend was sealed into a pair of swords. One was named demonic sword Dark Shadow, and the other was named demonic sword Radiant Cover.\nAs the leading member of the alliance, the Yuan family carried out the duty of guarding the pair of demonic swords and keeping a close eye on the sealed fiend by assigning two succeeding heirs to watch over them. This duty was passed down the Yuan family line for generations, but 10 years ago, during the succession rite of the two genius siblings, the swords disappeared after a horrible massacre that took the lives of several prominent Yuan family members.\nAlong with the disappearance of the two swords brilliant siblings, there was a grim rumor that the demonic swords had bewitched the siblings. After the tragic incident, the next head of the Yuan family did everything in their power to find the treasured swords of the family, but the swords were nowhere to be found. After many years, the demonic sword Dark Shadow resurfaced to the world, with Kibera as its master.\n\nThe demonic sword Night Sky is a weapon that emanates Yin Mana due to harnessing the power of an archfiend blessed by the moon. In the East, Night Sky is famously associated with the 'Master of Yuho Mountains,' an archfiend who commands the fiends of the Yuho mountain range.\nThe master of Yuho Mountains is a former teacher of Kibera who vanashied shorty with the demonic sword Night Sky, but the demonic sword came under the possession of Idrian, the advisor to the emporor of the Vespian Empire. Night Sky was offered to Kibera as a reward for agreeing to a particular contract.\nKibera hadn't a single clue as to how the emperor's advisor came into possession of his master's sword, whether the advisor knew his master's whereabouts nor what he was after, but he could not pass the opportunity to obtain a powerful demonic sword that had ties to his master. Kibera accepted Idrian's proposal to join the Hound Unit.\n\nThe demonic sword Veil is a weapon that emanates Yang mana by drawing power from a gemstone that harnessed sunlight. It was used by the Demon commander whom Kibera fought while carrying out the Demon territory recon mission under Fluss' order.\nThe Demon commander was a powerful, high-ranking Demon who was hungry for greater power. Hungry for power, he insisted on using Veil, a sword of that was out of his league. Eventually his desire for Veil led to the sword corrupting the Demon's mind. The Demon commander became a puppet of the demonic sword and started destroying the ruins recklessly. The entire Hound Unit had to fight the Demon to take him down.\nKibera requested the demonic sword Veil, which can even control high-ranking Demons, to be given as a 'rightful reward' for his efforts, while neglecting his actual mission of searching the ruins. Mitra was uninterested in any swords, Pansirone said it wasn't her 'style,' and wanting to get back to the mission, Crow gave permission and thus, Veil was added to Kibera's collection of demonic swords."

Some would see a harbor village on the brink of ruin, some would see a paradise deep inside the mountains, while some others would see the maw of a black tiger, and be consumed by that black tiger.\nThe haunted scroll from the rumors passed through many hands until it became Kibera's first exorcism target. Instead, Kibera took a liking to the shifting background of the picture and decided to add it to his collection.\nWhen Kibera left his family, the scroll was one of the items that he had to leave behind. However, he was later reunited with the scroll at the night market of the fiends while he was still staying in the East.\nIt was that moment when Kibera felt a string of destiny pulling him toward the scroll. he emptied his teacher's picket and became the master of the haunted scroll once again."

Its plan was well on its way until the Master of Yuho Mountains appeared.\nWhite Night, the archfiend who was known as the Master of Yuho Mountains, took pity on Kibera, who was wandering aimlessly after running away from his family, took him in and taught how to suppress the power of Dark Shadow that was slowly consuming him.\nIt was then when Dark Shadow's plan to make Kibera his host and break free, failed.\n\nUnwilling to let Dark Shadow take control over him, Kibera swore to become stronger by using the Mana of all his demonic swords. Since then, he started to collect demonic swords across the continent. Unfortunately, the Mana of each demonic sword he acquired through many means could not harmonize with each other and ended up sinking to the depths, untapped. Kibera could only mindlessly collect demonic swords.\nWorst comes to worst, after gaining the demonic sword Night Sky from a contract, Kibera's Mana balance drastically declined to Yin, pushing him closer to the fiend side. Despite the haunting situation, the emperor's advisor who gave him Night Sky smiled softly and simply delivered a prophecy that a sword he will soon acquire will help.\nKibera set the advisor's prophecy aside and continued to seize demonic swords faster, more fiercly, and more viciously. Kibera had someone to reunite with, after all. He had an answer to hear, and above all... he could not allow the monster to turn him into a fiend controlled by a sword.\n\nOne Day, during an expedition to the ruins, Kibera came in contact with the demonic sword he so desired and charged faster than lightning to grab the sword.\nHe fell anyone be it ally or foe \u2013 who stood in his way and firmly grasped the beckoning demonic sword with shattering force. At that moment, he finally remembered the prophecy and realized the answer.\n the overflowing Yang Mana that was swirling inside the demonic sword Veil intertwined itself with the Yin Mana of Night Sky like grand tidal waves and weaved the separate powers of every demonic sword into one, becoming part of Kibera's strength.\n\nWith the countless demonic swords along with Night Sky and Veil, Kibera finally was able to draw the true power of Dark Shadow and wielded great strength to his will."
