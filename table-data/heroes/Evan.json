        "story_": "The Gretchen family is a high-ranking vampire family that is called as the guardian of wisdom and the pursuer of knowledge. They have poured their efforts into the study and knowledge of magic for centuries. While they were the distant relatives of the princess Lewisia, they always have upheld the rule of not interfering with the humans, as they believed humans were fools who were easily swayed by greed. But when the current head of the family, Vilhelmina La Gretchen, married a human, their immense knowledge that was concealed for centuries finally became accessible to humans. Barsi, the human who married Vilhelmina and took on her surname, was an alchemist of the Tower of Sage. He had been studying the beings of darkness which the vampires commanded and the darkness that had spread in the world. When he first heard rumors of the Gretchen family, he went to them and asked to become their student. After many incidents, Vilhelmina and Barsi soon became fast friends and came to love each other deeply. That is how Evan La Gretchen, one of the most brilliant among the Tower of Sage alchemists as well as the half-blood child of Vilhelmina and the human alchemist Barsi, was born.\n\nUnfortunately, Evan was weak from birth. Although he had inherited his mother's great darkness, his body was the same as a human, and therefore couldn't bear the dark power. He was always on the verge of death. and he couldn't even walk properly. In addition, since one of the properties of darkness was absorption, he was in constant danger of being devoured by his mother's power. After thinking about it for some time, Barsi took Evan and returned to the Tower of Sage, while Vilhelmina remained in her castle and continued to seek a way that her son could live more safely.\nThankfully, Evan grew to be optimistic and positive, just like his father and showed interest in researching darkness. As he grew older, he tried to control the darkness within him. He acquired extensive knowledge of runes, alchemy. and elemental magic, becoming the greatest alchemist of the Tower of Sage at the age of 15. The only thing that he couldn't use was the magic that controls blood. Although the blood of a high-ranking vampire flowed in his veins, his body was too weak to hold up against the use of such magic. Despite this fact, he has achieved countless accomplishments, such as creating his own homunculus Naav Gehen as well as studying and observing the darkness that affects the world with Lewisia. To commend his talent and accomplishments, the Tower of Sage granted him the title of 'Green,' meaning 'Researcher'\u2014 an honorable title given only to those who have attained incredible success with their research.\n\nWhile he still sometimes experiences slight pains and aches due to his inherently weak body when the power of darkness becomes stronger, nonetheless he has learned to survive without the help of his parents. Now, he is able to use his power of darkness freely and shows interest in the demonic energy of demons and the power of dragons as well. He also discovered a new type of darkness that is completely different from the currently existing darkness, and named it 'Tidhar.' Until recently, Evan had been staying at the Tower of Sage, continuing his research on darkness, and keeping a close eye on the 'Eclipse phenomenon' discovered in the Aegina Desert. When he received a letter from Lewisia asking him for help on the darkness that appeared in the desert, he left for the sandy lands with Naav Gehen by his side."

Amazingly, the darkness he discovered had eyes, could talk, and was even aware of Evan.\n\u2018You made me. What... are you?\u2019\nThat was how Evan and his creation, Naav Gehen the homunculus first met.\n\nThough Naav Gehen looks like a sphere made from darkness, he can transform into anything he wants. He is usually called by a nickname, 'Naav,' and he dislikes it when people other than Evan use his nickname. He loves his creator Evan more than anything, and dislikes, even hates, those who try to harm him. He is an emotional creature, throwing tantrums when he feels irritated, and acting affectionate when he feels happy. While he can be rather temperamental and hard to take care of, Evan always seems to be able to coax him and soothe him.\n\nNaav usually lives in a flask filled with a special liquid, but he can come out whenever he wants to. Since his body can pass through anything, it doesn't matter what shape his home is, but Evan made him a flask because that's what Naav wanted. Evan even sometimes changes the shape or the color of the flask according to Naav's various moods.\nMaking the flask fly is one of Naav Gehen's powers, which is used when Evan and Naav are on the move. For Evan, Naav does not mind going outside the flask and unleashing its full power. The life gifted by Evan. The power gifted by Evan. No matter what Evan thinks of him, Naav Gehen will gladly use its darkness for its creator."

That was when Veronica showed up. Evan was overjoyed that someone besides Dominix would be his friend and discuss magical knowledge with him. Veronica felt the same.\nAfter Veronica became the Guild Manager and left the tower, the two couldn't meet as much as they used to. Nonetheless, Evan was happy about Veronica's success, and Veronica supported Evan's research as well. Whenever Evan achieved a breakthrough in his research, he always wrote a letter to Veronica, proudly telling her about his achievements. The first time he was dispatched was no different.\n\u2018Mother worries too much. She keeps telling me that I might die if I became influenced by the darkness on my travels. But even if I were to stay at the tower, that still might be my fate. I love the tower and its people, but I don't want to stay here forever. If I'm doomed to live in such a fragile body, shouldn't I live each day to the fullest? I want to see the world, Veronica. I want to see my research completed.\u2019\nEven though he wrote a long letter. there was no answer. Evan knew Veronica was always busy and didn't take it to heart. But when he received a letter on the day of his departure, he smiled brightly. The rock was obviously carved in a hurry and was rough around the edges, but was inscribed with carefully written runes wishing for the owner's good health and safety.\n\u2018You're going to do great, Evan.

            "story": "A dowsing pendulum that Barsi completed based on Gretchen's knowledge. The weight is in the shape of a pen nib, the symbol of the Gretchen family. A ring that is granted only to the head of the Gretchen family hangs from the end, given to Barsi from Vilhelmina as a wedding present. Whenever someone with great darkness is near, or a core of darkness is detected, the weight moves in that direction.\nBecause the weight contained darkness, and part of the pendulum belonged to a pure-blood vampire, it was too dangerous to be around young Evan. So Vilhelmina kept it when Evan went to the Tower of Sage and sealed it away, fearing for her son's safety.\nAfter Evan was able to use his powers of darkness freely, he went to his mother's castle. This was after his father died. Vilhelmina recognized her son the moment she saw him, and gave him the dowsing pendulum.\nI've waited for the day I could give you this. I'm sure your father would be happy if he could be here. I hope this helps with your research."

Whenever Evan conducted his experiments or wrote in his research journal, Naav would watch him from the inside the flask. After Naav became too big for the flask, Evan gave him another flask, but Naav often became nostalgic and stayed inside his old flask. One day, Evan discovered Naav devastated on the floor. having broken the flask by accident.\n\u2018Don't be sad. Naav. I can make this flask into your home!\u2019\nEvan cut out the broken parts and made it into an entrance. He even put a small bed inside for Naav. Afterward, whenever Naav returned from a dispatch mission with Evan or spent too much of his power, he rests in this flask. He also collected various items that he liked, such as broken glass pieces of the flask, rock fragments that Evan broke during his experiments. the bouquet that the people of the Tower of Sage gave him, his favorite feather ornaments and so forth. With those, he adorned the inside of his flask. Now, this flask has become not only Naav's home, but also a precious treasure that holds Evan's dear memories."

        "story": "Naav Gehen was impulsive and fickle. He would be happy one moment and irritated the next. As he always stayed by Evan's side, he had never caused any problems, but people who knew what happened to those who hurt Evan in front of Naav didn't even dare to touch the flask's string. But to Evan, Naav was simply a small, cute friend who was affectionate and sweet. Evan did have some concerns about Naav, but those concerns were a little different from what other people worried about. Naav Gehen was a living creature who was clearly aware of his name and existence. Evan wanted Naav to think for himself and to be a little more independent. He didn't want Naav to idly follow his orders or blindly obey him, but he wanted Naav to be a free being. Naturally, Naav Gehen didn't understand.\n\u2018But Evan made me... Is it wrong to do as Evan says?\u2019\n\u2018No. I'm glad you like me that much. But I still wish you were a little more free. Not just making little complaints or throwing light tantrums, but truly deciding and acting on your own free will.\u2019\nIf the ones that feared Naav Gehen had heard those words, they would have surely fainted on the spot. Regardless, Naav was not able to accept Evan's words.\n\u2018I don't understand... My will doesn't matter. Evan's will is my will. It's what I want to do. I don't want to know anything else.\u2019\n\u2018No. You'll understand someday, Naav.\u2019\nEvan smiled brightly, stroking the flask.\n\u2018I made you that way.\u2019\n\nOne day, Naav Gehen finally felt his own resolve\u2014 it was the moment when Evan's voice that resisted the darkness became faint and died away. It was the moment that Evan sometimes spoke of, the very moment that Evan's life felt like it was about to end. That was when Naav Gehen sucked up all the darkness around him and rapidly expanded. Anything that harms my creator, I will absorb, devour, erase, and destroy. Ironically, Naav Gehen's tormented scream gave form to his shapeless mass. and he grew at an explosive speed. His enormous power even absorbed the darkness that had swallowed Evan and made it belong only to 'Naav Gehen.' Evan, whose darkness had lifted for the first time thanks to Naav Gehen, opened his eyes and smiled as he saw that his research had been right. The wings of graceful black and brilliant green had finally spread wide and were wrapped around Evan as if it were protecting him."
