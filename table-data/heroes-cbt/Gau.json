However, he suddenly disappeared for 10 years. When he returned, he was a completely changed man. His violent Barbarian tendencies were all gone, even when others criticized him. Instead, he now faces them with smiles and jolly laughter. The kind, warm gaze he now shows to children and animals is especially surprising.",
