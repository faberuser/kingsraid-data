Having been harassed and ostracized by other Goblins due to his skin color, he feels no compassion toward his kind. He would gladly shoot, blow up, and smash even a fellow Goblin to test his weapons. However, he also expresses his gratitude to those who help him, and this is how he became Roi's friend. Unfortunately, he is terrible at remembering faces, so he often tries to shoot Roi before he recalls who he is.",
