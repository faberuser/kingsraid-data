Crimson arcane crystals resonated with Kirze,\nand she absorbed all the crystals in the area.\nAs a result, she gained vast amount of mana and gained ability to manipulate crimson arcane crystals at her will.\n\nWith her new found power, Kirze defeated Malduk's subordinates and fled from the lab with the surviving children.\n\nIn the hopes of preventing further casualties like herself, Kirze took off and began to hunt rouge demons that crossed her path...",
