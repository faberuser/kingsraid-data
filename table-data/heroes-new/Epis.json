Even during the Demon War, she chose traveling around on her own over joining the invasion. In her eyes, fighting alongside Kyle was interesting enough for her to even betray her own kind. When she later met Kasel, she gladly joined his party, knowing that she found another fun adventure for herself. When she finds attractive men, she sometimes visits them in their dreams.",
