The Tamian race lives in harmony with nature, and they have the ability to read its flow and guide the souls of the dead. Rephy's ability as a soul guide is exceptional, even for a Tamian. He uses it to guide the souls of those who died in the forest and help them pass on, preventing them from turning evil. He is the most capable among the Tamians in discerning the paths of the stars, pacifying the souls of the dead, and properly guiding them to the afterlife.",
