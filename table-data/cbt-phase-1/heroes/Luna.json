One day, a Lulu child was born with the exact opposite personality that is typical her race. That child is Luna. It's not that she was unhappy with the ways of her people. Nor did she have any grand purpose of experiencing the world outside. She was simply picking flowers, one step at a time. Another step to pick up some frozen branches for her slingshot. And another step to follow the scent of some sweet, red fruit. Before she knew it, she was outside, running toward a carrot field away from the mountain.",
