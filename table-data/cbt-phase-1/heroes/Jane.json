The Dukedom of Gray, wiped off the map by the Demon invaders during the Demon War, was the protector of countless secrets, including the ruins and technologies of an ancient civilization. Jane, too, lost her life to protect those secrets. Later, she was brought back to the world as an undead by Malduk, a high-ranking officer and a strategist of the Demon Army. She was given a new consciousness by a strange, dark magic. Now, she seeks to go on a journey to find her past self and her lost memories.",
