Many people consider him a dependable defender of Orvel, but due to his lack of interest in wealth and success, his actual rank within the order has never been very high. He grew up together with Kasel and Frey in the same orphanage, and he loves his land as the home of those precious to him. He recently volunteered to join the expedition to investigate the King's Plains.",
